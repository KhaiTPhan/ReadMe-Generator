## Description

#### Motivation

When creating an open source project on GitHub, itâ€™s important to have a high-quality README for the app. Writing one from scratch can be time-consuming and there's the risk you might leave oout an important section.

#### Key features

This is a command-line application to generate a READMe file in markdown language which can easily be incorporated into GitHub. It runs on node.js and the inquirer package. The user will be asked to answer a series of questions which will then populate the README file.

#### Technologies used

* JavaScript
* Node.JS
* Inquirer npm
